#Class Exercises Week 5 ggplot

#Your Turn
#Q1. Review your data set mpg


#Q2. Summarize your data set mpg to determine size, column names, characteristics of the data set.



#Q3. Using ggplot() create a scatterplot to describe the relationship between displ  and hwy.
#displ is the  size of the car engine (in liters)
#hwy is the carâ€™s fuel efficiency on the highway (miles/gallon).


#Q4. Using the geom_function, add a layer to your scatterplot to differentiate the different types of cars, defined by the class variable.
#Hint: Use the aesthetic function



#Q5. Using the geom_function, create a line plot to establish the relationship between displ and hwy.



#Q6. Using the geom_function, add a layer to your scatterplot to create a smooth line to differentiate the different types
#of cars, defined by the class variable.



#Q7. Using the geom_function, add a layer to your scatterplot to create a smooth line just for the subcompact cars in the class variable.
